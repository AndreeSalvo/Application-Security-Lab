<h1>Application Security</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
I completed a series of hands-on cybersecurity labs and a vulnerability analysis project focused on identifying, exploiting, and mitigating real-world web application and system vulnerabilities. I examined web technologies from an attacker’s perspective, analyzing HTML and XHTML source code to understand how strict syntax and validation rules impact security and reliability. I conducted web server attacks and wireless security testing, including manipulating server content and logs, cracking WEP and WPA traffic, and evaluating why legacy encryption protocols are insecure compared to modern standards like WPA2 and WPA3.

I performed multiple web application exploitation techniques, including SQL injection, stored cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, and session hijacking, to demonstrate how insecure input handling and outdated code can lead to data theft and system compromise. Using tools such as Metasploit and Kali Linux, I simulated real-world attacks to identify weaknesses before they could be exploited by malicious actors. I also analyzed privilege escalation scenarios and assessed the risks associated with interpreted languages like PHP.

For the final project, I researched and documented real vulnerabilities, including an Apache directory traversal flaw and a PHP denial-of-service vulnerability, using CVE and CVSS scoring. I validated remediation efforts by testing patched systems and confirming that upgrades successfully mitigated the identified risks. Throughout all labs and the project, I focused on defensive takeaways—such as secure coding practices, patch management, input validation, logging, and monitoring—and translated technical findings into clear documentation suitable for both technical and nontechnical audiences.
